# Coffee Chatbot Pro
When in doubt, drink more coffee!


#### A Coffee-order taking ChatBot implementation using Loops

The previous Coffee Chatbot project featured an implementation of a Python chatbot for ordering one cup of coffee by leveraging recursive functions, user inputs, and print statements. Here that chatbot is taken to the next level by adding loops! and utilizing multiple files for our project functions.

We use Loops to add the following extra features:
  * Placing an order for multiple drinks


## Development
* Clone the repo unto your system
* Navigate into the folder containing the code base
* Run the following in Bash

```
$ python3 script.py
```

## File System
* **Script.py** This contains our major chatbot function and other sub-functions
* **utils.py** This contains sub-functions that will under minimal change/improvements
