# Coffee Chatbot Pro
When in doubt, drink more coffee!

#### A Coffee-order taking ChatBot implementation using Loops

The previous Coffee Chatbot project featured an implementation of a Python chatbot for ordering one cup of coffee by leveraging recursive functions, user inputs, and print statements. The solution code from that project is carried over here. Now, it‚Äôs time to take this chatbot to the next level by adding loops!

Loops allow us to perform some action repeatedly ‚Äì such as placing an order for multiple drinks ‚Äì without needing to write an excess amount of code. You‚Äôll be doing this here! Write all your code in the file called script.py and run it by entering python3 script.py in the terminal.

## Development
* Clone the repo unto your system
* Navigate into the folder containing the code base
* Run the following in Bash

```
$ python3 <file_name>.py
```
